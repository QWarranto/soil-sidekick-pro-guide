# LeafEngines B2B API — Marketing Pitch Content

---

## Headline

**Turn Plant Intelligence Into Business Value**

LeafEngines transforms botanical identification into actionable enterprise data—reducing risk, accelerating decisions, and unlocking new revenue streams.

---

## The Problem

| Industry | Pain Point |
|----------|------------|
| **Urban Forestry** | Manual tree assessments cost $50-150/tree. Liability exposure from undetected hazardous assets. Grant compliance documentation is fragmented. |
| **Crop Insurance** | Claims processing takes 14-21 days. Subjective damage assessments lead to disputes. Fraud detection relies on manual inspection. |
| **Herbal Medicine** | Adulteration incidents cost $2M+ per recall. Supply chain verification is paper-based. Regulatory compliance is reactive, not proactive. |
| **Precision Agriculture** | Generic recommendations waste inputs. Localized environmental data requires multiple subscriptions. Integration with existing FMS is manual. |

---

## The Solution

### LeafEngines Environmental Intelligence API

One API. Four high-value verticals. Zero infrastructure burden.
