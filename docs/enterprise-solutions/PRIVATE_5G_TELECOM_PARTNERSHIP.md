# Private 5G Telecom Partnership
## LeafEngines™ as the Value-Realization Layer for Agricultural 5G

**Service Code:** LE-5G-PARTNER  
**Target Partners:** Verizon Business, T-Mobile for Business, AT&T Business, Regional Telecoms  
**Contract Structure:** Revenue-share or Platform License

---

## Executive Summary

Telecommunications providers are investing billions in Private 5G infrastructure for enterprise verticals, but struggle to justify the investment to agricultural enterprises without a compelling software layer. LeafEngines provides the "killer app" that transforms Private 5G from a connectivity investment into a productivity multiplier.

**Telecoms sell the pipe. We sell the reason the pipe is worth buying.**
