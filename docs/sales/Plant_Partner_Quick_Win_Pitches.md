## 1. easyplant

### Company Profile

- **Segment**: Premium self-watering houseplants ($50-$300+)
- **Scale**: 1,000,000+ plants shipped
- **Target**: Urban professionals who "can't keep plants alive"

### The Problem (from public reviews)

- High price with no long-term value → One-time purchase, no retention
- Self-watering reliability concerns → Support burden
- No reporting or tracking → No engagement after purchase
- 12-month purchase lifecycle → Low repeat purchases

### What We Enable

**Personalized Plant Health Intelligence**
- Monthly health assessments calibrated to local conditions
- Proactive alerts based on environmental changes
- Watering optimization that accounts for [*proprietary factors*]
- Expansion recommendations using [*compatibility methodology*]

### Projected Business Impact

| Metric | Current | With LeafEngines |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Customer lifetime value | ~$150 | $300+ |
| Repeat purchase rate | ~15% | 35%+ |
| Support ticket volume | Baseline | -40% |

### Investment

- **Starter Tier**: $5,520/year ($500/month) — 50,000 API calls/month
- **Professional Tier**: $16,560/year ($1,500/month) — 250,000 API calls/month with satellite data
- **ROI**: Projected based on customer scale

## 2. Fast Growing Trees

### Company Profile

- **Segment**: Online nursery - trees, shrubs, fruit trees
- **Scale**: 2.6M+ customers, 70,000+ 5-star reviews
- **Differentiator**: 1-year guarantee, zone-filtered recommendations

### The Problem (from public reviews)

- Plants arrive in poor condition → Returns, guarantee claims
- Planting uncertainty → Customer anxiety, failures
- USDA Zones too coarse → Right zone, wrong outcome

### What We Enable

**The core insight**: USDA Hardiness Zones are insufficient. Zone 7 covers Virginia to Oklahoma—completely different conditions. Our [*proprietary scoring methodology*] provides precision that zones cannot.

**Pre-Purchase Confidence**
- Customer sees success probability for their specific address
- Alternative suggestions when compatibility is low
- [*Multiple environmental factors*] considered before purchase

**Post-Purchase Success**
- Planting windows based on [*localized data analysis*]
- Proactive failure prevention through [*environmental monitoring*]
- Expansion recommendations using [*same compatibility engine*]

### Projected Business Impact

| Metric | Current | With LeafEngines |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Guarantee claim rate | ~5-8% | 3% or less |
| Return customer rate | ~20% | 35%+ |
| Average order value | $80-120 | Higher |

### Investment

- **Starter Tier**: $5,520/year ($500/month) — 50,000 API calls/month
- **Professional Tier**: $16,560/year ($1,500/month) — includes satellite monitoring
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for 2.6M+ customer scale
- **Cost Savings**: Projected based on claim reduction
- **ROI**: Calculated during Impact Simulator session

*Scoring methodology and volume pricing disclosed under NDA.*

## 3. Gardyn

### Company Profile

- **Segment**: Indoor hydroponic systems with AI assistant
- **Scale**: 100,000+ households
- **Price Point**: $400-$900 hardware + $49/month membership
- **Differentiator**: AI-powered growing ("Kelby"), camera/sensor monitoring

### The Problem (from public reviews)

- High upfront cost → Conversion barrier
- Ongoing maintenance required → Churn risk
- Limited to indoor system → Missed expansion opportunity

### What We Enable

**The opportunity**: Gardyn's sensors measure what's happening *inside* the unit. We add awareness of what's happening *outside*—but through a [*proprietary integration methodology*] that enhances rather than competes with existing AI.

**Enhanced Intelligence**
- Automatic adjustments based on [*regional environmental factors*]
- Seasonal engagement that demonstrates ongoing value
- Indoor-outdoor transition guidance using [*location-specific timing*]
- Sustainability metrics calculated via [*our measurement framework*]

### Projected Business Impact

| Metric | Current | With LeafEngines |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Membership churn | ~15% annual | 10% |
| Customer success rate | ~80% | 90%+ |
| Outdoor expansion | None | New product line opportunity |

### Investment

- **Annual**: Custom ($25,000-$50,000)
- **Includes**: Kelby AI integration, sensor fusion protocol, indoor-outdoor transition module
- **Retention Impact**: $2.94M retained ARR projected
- **ROI**: 159:1 projected

*Integration architecture and custom service scope provided during technical evaluation.*
