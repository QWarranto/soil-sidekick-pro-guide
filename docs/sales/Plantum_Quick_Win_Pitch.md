# LeafEngines™ Partnership Proposal for Plantum

**Prepared for:** Plantum Leadership Team  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Classification:** Confidential — Partner Evaluation

---

## Executive Summary

Plantum has achieved strong positioning in plant identification, but faces the existential threat common to mid-tier apps: **feature gap with top competitors**.

LeafEngines offers a **surgical solution**: integrate our Environmental Intelligence Layer to unlock premium features that drive retention—without R&D investment or infrastructure burden.

**The Ask:** 12-month Starter Tier license at $8,900/year  
**The Offer:** Immediate access to differentiated capabilities

---

## The Problem: The Vulnerable Middle

### Market Position

Top 5 apps enjoy 2.3x higher retention, 2.3x higher premium conversion, and 40% more organic installs.

**The Gap Source:** Premium features (environmental context, personalized calendars, proactive alerts) require significant R&D investment to build internally.

**Our Solution:** Access equivalent capabilities in days, not months.
